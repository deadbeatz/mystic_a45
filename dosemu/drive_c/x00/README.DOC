          fix bugs  in other  software.   It  has reached  a  point that  I
          anything I touch will  break something.  The current  source code
          of X00 is too hard to work with.

          Version 1.50 will be the last X00 using the original source code.
          The next version will be  a total rewrite.  This should put me in
          a position where I can again support X00.
