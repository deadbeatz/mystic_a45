          Copyright (C) 1987, 1988,  1989, 1990 by Raymond  L. Gwinn.   ALL
          RIGHTS  RESERVED. COMMERCIAL  DISTRIBUTION AND/OR  USE PROHIBITED
          WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM RAYMOND L. GWINN.

          Non-Commercial distribution  and/or  use is  permitted under  the
          following terms:

          1. You may  copy and  distribute verbatim  copies of  X00 as  you
          receive it,  in any medium,  provided that you  conspicuously and
          appropriately  publish  on each  copy  a  valid copyright  notice
          "Copyright  (C)  1987,  1988, 1989,  1990,  1991,  1992, 1993  by
          Raymond  L. Gwinn";  keep intact  the notices  on all  files that
          refer  to  this  License Agreement  and  to  the  absence of  any
          warranty;   PROVIDE  UNMODIFIED  COPIES OF  THE DOCUMENTATION  AS
          PROVIDED WITH THE PROGRAM; and give any other recipients of X00 a
          copy of this License  Agreement along with the program.   You may
          charge  a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a
          copy, but no more than is  necessary to recover your actual costs
          incurred in the  transfer. Under  no circumstances is  X00 to  be
          distributed in such a way as to be construed as  "value added" in
          a sales  transaction,  such  as,  but not  limited  to,  software
          bundled with a modem or CD-ROM software collections.

          2.  Mere  aggregation  of  another unrelated  program  with  this
          program  (or  its  derivative)  on  a  volume  of  a  storage  or
          distribution medium does  not bring the  other program under  the
          scope of these terms. 

          3.  You  may not  copy,  sublicense, distribute  or  transfer X00
          except  as expressly provided under this  License Agreement.  Any
          attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer X00
          is  void and your  rights to use  the program under  this License
          agreement  shall be automatically  terminated.   However, parties
          who have received computer software  programs from you with  this
          License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long
          as such parties remain in full compliance, and notify the Authors
          of their intention to comply with this Agreement. 

          4.  If you  wish to  include X00  with other free  programs whose
          distribution conditions are different, please contact  Raymond L.
          Gwinn at the addresses listed below.  A simple rule,  that can be
          stated here,  has not been  worked out, but this  will usually be
          permitted.

          5. For the purposes of this document, "COMMERCIAL USE" is defined
          as concurrent operation of the software on four or more computers
          or  data  lines owned  by the  same for-profit  organization. Any
          organization may  operate this software  under the terms  of this
          Non-Commercial Agreement if operation is limited to three or less
          computers or data lines.







                                   NO WARRANTY

          BECAUSE X00 IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY IS
          PROVIDED.  EXCEPT  WHEN OTHERWISE STATED  IN WRITING, RAYMOND  L.
          GWINN   AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE X00 "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
          OF  ANY KIND,  EITHER EXPRESSED  OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING,  BUT NOT
          LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
          FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
          PERFORMANCE OF X00 IS WITH YOU.   SHOULD X00 PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


          IN NO EVENT WILL RAYMOND L. GWINN AND/OR ANY OTHER  PARTY WHO MAY
          REDISTRIBUTE  X00  AS  PERMITTED  ABOVE,  BE  LIABLE  TO YOU  FOR
          DAMAGES,  INCLUDING  ANY  LOST  PROFITS, LOST  MONIES,  OR  OTHER
          SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL  OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING  OUT OF THE
          USE OR INABILITY  TO USE (INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED  TO LOSS  OF
          DATA  OR DATA BEING  RENDERED INACCURATE  OR LOSSES  SUSTAINED BY
          THIRD PARTIES  OR A  FAILURE OF THE  PROGRAM TO OPERATE  WITH ANY
          OTHER  PROGRAMS)  X00,  EVEN IF  YOU  HAVE  BEEN  ADVISED OF  THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.
