     NOTES ABOUT DOCUMENTATION
     -------------------------

     This documentation is about 10+ years out of date.  It is provided for
     now until it is rewritten.  The WHATSNEW file for 1.10 contains all of
     the changes and documentation of the features in 1.10 (for the most part)
     and should also be used as a reference guide.  Most of the features not
     mentioned in this documentation, can be found within the WHATSNEW.

     As always, AgoraNet BBS and FidoNet MYSTIC echos are great places to ask
     any questions as both are frequented by many Syops using Mystic as well
     as the author.

     DOOR MCI Codes: (used when running a door only)

     %0 Socket handle on Windows (1 on Unix)
     %1 Returns 1 (old comport code from DOS version)
     %2 Returns 38400 (old baud rate from DOS version)
     %3 Node number
     %4 User's IP address
     %5 User's host name
     %# User's permanent index number
     %T User's time left
     %P Node's temporary directory (where door drop files are created)
     %U User's handle (All spaces replaced with _ characters)

     Adding /DOS on a door command line will tell Mystic to create a DOS format
     drop file (ie, lines ending with CRLF) even when running on an operating
     system that may use a different format (ie Linux, etc)


     ---

     General notes (UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES):

     1. NEWUSER.MPX is executed (if it exists) after a user saves their
        new user information.

     2. TRASHCAN.DAT (stored in the data directory) can be used to block
        certain user names from being used by a new user.  This file is
        a straight DOS ASCII file with one user name per line.  For
        example:

           Mike Hunt
           Homer Simpson

        If the above were the contents of TRASHCAN.DAT in the data directory,
        Mystic will refuse to allow new users to use those listed names.

     3. When editing menus, the following can be used in the "hot key"
        field of the menu command:

             FIRSTCMD : Automatically run the command each time the menu is
                        loaded.
             EVERY    : Automatically run the command each time the menu is
                        redrawn (before its actually redrawn)
             AFTER    : Automatically run the command each time the menu is
                        redrawn, just before the prompt is displayed.

        When editing menus, the following can be used in the "hot key"
        field of the menu command in NON-LIGHTBAR menus only:

             ENTER  : Use the ENTER key as the hot key
             ESCAPE : Use the ESCAPE key as the hot key
             TAB    : Use the TAB key as the hot key
             RIGHT  : Use the RIGHT arrow as the hot key
             LEFT   : Use the LEFT arrow as the hot key

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Starting Mystic BBS
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Mystic are many command line options which can be used when executing
     the BBS.  If no command line option is supplied, Mystic will attempt to
     start up locally so that you may log into the BBS, automatically
     selecting the first available node for you.

     In addition to no command line, the following options can be used:

        -CFG     This tells Mystic to start in local configuration mode.

        -HOST$   This specifies the user's hostname which should be passed
                 into Mystic by the telnet server.  Ex: -HOSTphl.verizon.net
 
        -IP$     This specifies the user's IP address which should be passed
                 into Mystic by the telnet server.  Ex: -IP125.132.54.741

        -N#      This specifies a specific node number.  There is usually
                 no reason to use this, as Mystic will automatically select
                 an available node.  Ex: -N1 tells Mystic to start node 1.

        -T#      This specifies the number of numbers the user will be
                 permitted to use this session.  Ex: -T60 limits the user
                 to only an hour even if they have many hours of time left

        -TID#    This specifies the socket handle when using Mystic with a
                 third party telnet server under Windows

        -U$      This specifies the username to login to Mystic with and must
                 be used along side the -P command to supply the password.  If
                 a user name has a space in it, the spaces should be replaced
                 by an underscore.  For example:
 
                    mystic -uJoe_User -pMYPASSWORD

                 The above example will automatically attempt to login as the
                 Joe User.

         -X$     This specifies a MPL program to execute and then exit Mystic
                 afterwards.  The -U and -P must also be supplied with this
                 in order to tell Mystic which user to run the MPL program as

                    mystic -uJoe_User -pMYPASSWORD -xusage
 
                 The above will execute usage.mpx from the scripts directory
                 after logging in as Joe User, and then exit the BBS after
                 execution.
 

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Using the ACS System (Access Command Strings)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The ACS system is used throughout the BBS to limit access to certain
     commands and functions.  It is an extremely powerful system designed
     to give the SysOp total control over who can do what.  In any of the
     configuration editors where there is an ACS field, these commands are
     to be used.

     Mystic supports the following ACS commands:

          Ax  -  This command is used to check the user's age.  Where X is
                 the age the user must be in order to pass.

          Dx   - This command is used to check if a user has a certain flag
                 toggled ON in their SECOND set of flags.  Where X is the
                 flag which the user must have in order to pass.  For
                 example: DA will require the user to have user access flag
                 D in flag set 2 in order to pass.

          Ex  -  This command is used to check the user's current graphics
                 mode.  Where X is one of the following:

                      1 - User must have ANSI graphics
                      0 - User must have ASCII (none) graphics.

          Fx  -  This command is used to check if a user has a certain flag
                 toggled ON in their FIRST set of flags.  Where X is the
                 flag which the user must have in order to pass.  For
                 example: FA will require the user to have user access flag
                 A in flag set 1 in order to pass.

          Gx  -  This command is used to check if a user is in a certain
                 message group.  Where X is the number of the group as listed
                 in the message group editor.  For example: G1 will require
                 the user to be in message group #1 in order to pass.

          Hx  -  This command is used to check if a user is accessing
                 a command at a certain hour.  Where X is the hour in the
                 24-hour mode (ie 00 is midnight or after, 23 is 11pm or
                 after).  For example: H12 will prevent the user from
                 accessing this command before 12 noon on any given day.

          Nx  -  This command is used to check if a user is online a
                 certain node number.  For example: N1 will require that
                 the user is currently logged in on Node 1 in order to
                 pass.

          OA  -  This command is used to check the status of the user's
                 node message availibility.  If the user is able to
                 receive node messages, OA will return true.  False if
                 they are not available.

          OI  -  This command is used to check if a user's node status
                 is invisible to other nodes.  It will be set TRUE if
                 the user is invisible, false if not.

          OK  -  This command is used to check the result of the last
                 called Boolean menu command.  For more information, see
                 the menu commands: -P, -Y, and -N.

          OP  -  This command is used to check the status of the user's
                 post / call ratio.  If the user meets the currently set
                 ratio, then OP will be true - otherwise, if will return
                 false.  This option is useful to restrict users from
                 downloading if they're not active message posters.

          Sx  -  This command is used to check if a user meets a certain
                 security level.  For example: S20 will require the user
                 to have a security level of 20 or higher in order to
                 pass.

          Tx  -  This command is used to check if a user has at least
                 X minutes remaining in online time.  For example: T10
                 would require the user to have a least 10 minutes of
                 remaining time in order to pass.

          Ux  -  This command is used to check a user's permanent user
                 number, where X is the number of the permanent index the
                 user must match.  For example: U1 would require the user
                 to have the permanent user index of 1.  Each user's
                 permanent index is listed in the user editor, and no two
                 users will ever have the same permanent index number.

          Zx  -  This command is used to check if a user is in a certain
                 File Group.  Where X is the number of the group as listed
                 in the File Group editor.  For example, Z1 will require
                 the user to be in File Group #1 in order to pass the ACS
                 check.

     Any of the above commands can be used together to create an ACS string
     used by Mystic BBS.  Below are some examples of how they can be used:

          s255     - User must have security of 255 or higher.
          s255n1fA - User must have a security level of 255 or higher, be
                     currently logged into Node 1, and have user flag A
                     toggled on, in order to pass this ACS string.
          s10z1h12 - User must have a security level of 10 or higher,
                     be currently in File Group #1, and be accessing this
                     function after 12:00 noon, in order to pass this
                     ACS string.

     For added flexibility, Mystic also supports five logical operators
     which can be used in ACS strings:

          & = Logical AND
          | = Logical OR
          ! = Logical NOT
          ^ = Always TRUE
          % = Always FALSE

     In addition to the operators, Mystic BBS also allows parenthesis in ACS
     strings to allow evaluation of grouped ACS commands.  Some examples of
     using operators and grouping are:

          ^               Always returns TRUE.  Grants access to ALL users.
          %               Always returns FALSE. Grants access to NO users,
                          not even the SysOp.
          s10!s20         User must have a security level which is at least
                          10 but NOT 20 or greater.
          t20|s255        User must have 20 minutes of time remaining, OR
                          have a security level of 255.
          !(s255|fa)      User must NOT have a security level of 255 and flag
                          A toggled on.
          (s20fa)|(s255)  User must have a security level of 20 with flag A
                          toggled on, *OR* have a security level of 255 or
                          higher.

     As you can see, the access command system gives Mystic BBS an
     incredible amount of flexibility when it comes to system security!

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     [S] System Configuration
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The System Configuration is where setting up the BBS begins.  Here is
     where all of the basic BBS definitions are found, including System
     Paths, Modem Setup, and more.  Below is a screen capture of what the
     System Configuration screen looks like, followed by an explanation as
     to what each option does.

          System Configuration

          A. System Paths
          B. Modem/Node Settings
          C. General Settings
          D. File Area Settings
          E. Message Area Settings
          F. Network Settings
          L. Language Editor
          N. New User Settings

          Command (Q/Quit):

          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          [A] System Paths (System Configuration Editor)
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          The system paths option will allow you to setup and change the
          directories that Mystic BBS will use to store and process it's
          data files.  These paths are setup initially by the installation
          program and in most cases they don't need to be changed.  The
          follow options are available in the System Paths setup:

          System Paths

          A. System Path      : C:\MYSTIC\
          B. Data Path        : C:\MYSTIC\DATA\
          C. Message Base Path: C:\MYSTIC\MSGS\
          D. System Logs Path : C:\MYSTIC\LOGS\
          E. Protocol Path    : C:\MYSTIC\FILES\
          F. Archive Path     : C:\MYSTIC\ARCS\
          G. Local QWK Path   : C:\MYSTIC\
          H. File Attach Path : C:\MYSTIC\ATTACH\
          I. Script Path      : C:\MYSTIC\SCRIPT\

          Command (Q/Quit):

              [A] System Path
              ---------------
              The system path is the main BBS directory where
              MYSTIC.EXE and its supporting files are located.  In almost
              all cases, this directory never needs to be changed.

              [B] Data Path
              -------------
              The data path is the directory where Mystic BBS will
              store all of it's data files.  In almost all cases, this
              directory never needs to be changed.

              [C] Message Base Path
              ---------------------
              The message base path is the default directory where Mystic
              BBS will store it's message base data files.  Mystic BBS also
              allows the option of storing each message base in a different
              directory, but in most cases this is not needed and will just
              clutter up your hard drive.  For more information on storing
              message bases in different directories, see the Message Base
              Editor section.

              [D] System Logs Path
              --------------------
              The system logs path is the directory where Mystic BBS will
              keep an updated log file of BBS activity.  The log files can
              be used to see what each caller was doing while they were
              online.  These files are not used by Mystic BBS at all and
              exist for information purposes only.  It is a good idea to
              delete the files in this directory every so often so they
              do not become large and waste drive space.

              [E] Protocol Path
              -----------------
              The protocol path is the directory where all external
              protocol drivers are stored.  For more information on file
              transfer protocols, see the Protocol Editor section.

              [F] Archive Path
              ----------------
              The archive path is the directory where all external archive
              utilities are stored (ie PKZIP.EXE, RAR.EXE, ARJ.EXE, etc).
              For more information on archives, see the Archive Editor
              section.

              [G] Local QWK Path
              ------------------
              The local QWK path is the directory where Mystic BBS will
              create QWK offline mail packets if the user is logged into
              the BBS locally.  This directory usually points to the same
              directory of your offline mail reader, if you use one.  For
              more information, see the QWK Offline Mail section.

              [H] File Attach Path
              --------------------
              The file attach path is the directory where Mystic BBS will
              store files that are attached to messages.  Mystic BBS allows
              users to optionally include a file to any message posted on
              the BBS system.

              [I] Script Path
              ---------------
              The script path is the directory where all compiled Mystic
              BBS programming files are found.  Mystic BBS supports an
              internal programming language that can be used by SysOps
              to create games, utilities, or BBS enhancements with ease.
              For more information see the MPL.DOC file included with
              Mystic BBS.

          [C] General Settings (System Configuration Editor)
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          The General Settings section is where all the general options of
          the BBS are defined.  Below is a screen capture of the General
          Settings screen followed by an explanation as to what each option
          does:

          General Settings

          A. BBS Name   : Another Mystic BBS
          B. Sysop Name : Sysop
          C. System PW  :

          O. Login Terminal Mode: Detect
          P. BBS List Edit ACS  : s255
          R. Invisible Login ACS: s255
          S. Status Line Type   : 2 line

          Command (Q/Quit):

              [A] BBS Name
              ------------
              This option is used to define the name of your BBS.

              [B] System Operator (SysOp) Name
              --------------------------------
              This option is used to define the name of the System
              Operator (SysOp).

              [C] System Password
              -------------------
              This option is used to define a system password, which can be
              used if you wish to run a private BBS system which only
              someone who knows the password can access.  If this option is
              left blank, the system password option will be disabled.  If
              a system password is set, Mystic BBS will prompt the caller
              for the system password IMMEDIATELY after connecting to the
              BBS - before displaying anything else.  If the user does not
              correctly enter the system password, the display file
              CLOSED.XXX will be displayed, and the call will be terminated.

              [D] Sysop Password
              ------------------
              This option is used to define the Sysop password.  Any time
              one of the Sysop-related menu commands or functions is
              selected, the user will have to correctly input this password
              in order to access that Sysop function.

              [E] Default Start Menu
              ----------------------
              This option is used to define the default start menu.  The
              start menu is the first menu that the user will see after
              logging into the BBS.  It can be optionally defined by
              security level, or for each individual user.  If a start
              menu is NOT defined for the user's security level or for that
              specific user, Mystic BBS uses the default start menu as the
              first menu that the user will see.  For more information on
              the start menu, see the Security Level Editor section and/or
              the User Editor section.

              [F] Default Fallback Menu
              -------------------------
              This option is used to define the default fallback menu.  The
              fallback menu is the menu that is loaded if the menu the user
              is trying to access doesn't exist.  The fallback menu can be
              set for each menu in the Menu Editor, but if a fallback menu
              is not defined for the menu the user is trying to access,
              Mystic will use the default fallback menu.

              [G] Default Language File
              -------------------------
              This option is used to define the default language file.
              Mystic BBS supports the use of an unlimited number of
              language definitions which can be used to customize the
              the interface of your BBS.  The default language file MUST
              exist in the data directory, or Mystic BBS will return an
              error.  For more information on the Language system, see
              the Language Editor section.

              [H] Maximum Number of Nodes
              ---------------------------
              This option is used to define the maximum number of nodes
              currently in use.  Each copy of Mystic BBS is a node.  If you
              have multiple phone lines and need to run multiple copies of
              Mystic BBS, then each copy of Mystic you are running is a
              node.  For more information see the section on Setting up
              a Multi-Node BBS.

              [I] Screen Saver
              ----------------
              This option is used to define the number of minutes of
              inactivity to wait before activating the screen saver.  When
              running a BBS, the software can sometimes sit idle between
              calls for quite a while.  A screen saver has been implemented
              to prevent screen burn-in while waiting for calls.

              [J] Inactivity Time Out
              -----------------------
              This option is used to set the number of seconds a user can
              be idle before Mystic BBS will hang up on them for
              inactivity.

              [K] Sysop Chat Hours - Start
              ----------------------------
              This option is used to define when the Sysop will be
              available for chat.  If a user tries to page the Sysop
              during off hours, Mystic will not activate the page bell,
              but instead inform the user that the SysOp is not available
              and optionally ask the user if they'd like to send e-mail
              to the Sysop.

              [L] Sysop Chat Hours - End
              --------------------------
              This option goes along with the above option which defines
              the SysOp chat hours.

              [M] Allow Sysop E-Mail
              ----------------------
              If this option is set to Yes, the user will be asked if they
              would like to send e-mail to the SysOp if they try to page
              during off chat hours.

              [N] SysOp Chat Logging
              ----------------------
              If this option is set to Yes, Mystic BBS will record SysOp
              chat sessions to CHAT.LOG found in the logs directory.

              [O] Login Terminal Mode
              -----------------------
              This option sets how Mystic handles getting the users
              terminal emulation.  If set to Ask, Mystic will ask the
              user.  If set to detect, Mystic will attempt to detect
              which terminal emulation to use.  If set to Detect/Ask,
              Mystic BBS will attempt to detect and if ANSI isn't
              detected, the user will be asked.

              [P] BBS List Edit ACS
              ---------------------
              This option defines the ACS string required to edit entries
              in the BBS list.  Mystic will also allow the user who added
              the entry in the BBS list to edit it regardless of this
              ACS string.

              [R] Invisible Login ACS
              -----------------------
              This option defines the ACS string required for a user to
              have the option of logging onto the BBS as "invisible" mode.
              When a user is logged in as invisible, they will not appear
              in any of the Who's Online listings.

              [S] Status Line Type
              --------------------
              This option defines the type of "status line" that Mystic BBS
              will use.  The status line is at the bottom of the screen
              where information on the logged in user is displayed.  Valid
              options are 1 line, 2 lines, and none.  This can also be
              toggled by pressing ALT-T while a user is online.

              [1-4] Sysop Macro
              -----------------
              These options define the SysOp macros.  A SysOp macro is
              text that is displayed whenever a macro key is pressed.
              Mystic supports four macro keys: F1 through F4.  The text
              defined for each of these keys will be pushed into the input
              buffer whenever they are pressed, just as if it was actually
              typed in.

          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          [D] File Area Settings (System Configuration Editor)
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          The File Area Settings section is where all options relating to
          the file transfer bases are found.  Below is a screen capture of
          the File Area Settings screen followed by an explanation of
          what each option does:

          File Settings

          A. Compress area numbers : Yes
          B. File area list columns: 2

          C. Import FILE_ID.DIZ    : Yes
          D. Max File Desc. Lines  : 20
          E. Auto-validate ACS     : s255
          F. See unvalidated files : s255
          G. DL unvalidated files  : s255
          H. See Failed Files      : s255
          I. DL Failed Files       : s999
          J. Min UL Space (kb)     : 1000
          K. Min CD Copy Space (kb): 1000
          L. Redisplay File Header : Yes
          M. Default Upload Base   : 0

          N. Test uploaded files   : No
          O. Pass errorlevel       : 0
          P. Test command line     :

          Command (Q/Quit):

              [A] Compress File Area Numbers
              ------------------------------
              This option, if toggled on, will compress file area numbers
              so they are always sequential during a file area list.  So
              in a file area list, if a user does not have access to area
              number 2, then the next area that the user does have access
              to will become area number 2.

              [B] File Area List Columns
              --------------------------
              This option allows the number of columns used in the file area
              lists to be configured.  Valid options are 1 or 2 columns.
              Note: If you change this to 1 column listings, you will have
              to edit the file area list prompt to reflect a single listing.

              [C] Import FILE_ID.DIZ
              ----------------------
              This option, if toggled on, will allow Mystic BBS to search
              all uploaded files for a FILE_ID.DIZ file.  The FILE_ID.DIZ
              file is included in many archives and contains a description
              of the file.  If this file is found, Mystic BBS will
              automatically read the description and use it as the file
              description in the file listing.

              [D] Max File Description Lines
              ------------------------------
              This option defines the maximum number of file description
              lines which can be used for each file entry.  It must be
              within the range of 1 to 99.

              [E] Auto Validate ACS
              ---------------------
              This option defines the ACS string a user must pass in
              order for the files they upload to be marked as validated.
              If they do not pass this ACS string, the files will be
              marked as unvalidated.

              [F] See Unvalidated Files ACS
              -----------------------------
              This option defines the ACS string a user must pass in
              order for unvalidated files to appear in a file listing.

              [G] Download Unvalidated Files ACS
              ----------------------------------
              This option defines the ACS string a user must pass in
              order to download a file that is marked as unvalidated.

              [H] See Failed Files ACS
              ------------------------
              If upload testing is toggled on and a file fails the upload
              test, they will be marked as "failed".  This option defines
              the ACS a user must have to see files which have failed the
              upload test in their file listing.

              [I] Download Failed Files ACS
              -----------------------------
              This option defines the ACS a user must meet in order to
              download a file which has been marked as "failed".

              [J] Minimum UL Space (kb)
              -------------------------
              Mystic BBS has the option to refuse to accept uploaded files
              when drive space gets low.  This option sets the number of
              kilobytes that must exist in order for Mystic BBS to accept
              uploads.  If this option is set to zero (0), it will be
              disabled.

              [K] Minimum CD Copy Space (kb)
              ------------------------------
              This option specifies the number of kilobytes which must be
              available on the BBS drive for Mystic BBS to use it's
              CD-ROM copy feature.

              When a file area is marked as a "CD-ROM" file area, Mystic
              BBS will attempt to copy files from the CD-ROM to the
              temporary directory before a user downloads it.  This keeps
              the access to the CD-ROM drive minimal, since CD drives are
              usually much slower than a hard drive.

              [L] Redisplay File Header
              -------------------------
              This option specifies whether Mystic BBS will redisplay the
              file header after a pause during standard file listings.

              [M] Default Upload Base
              -----------------------
              This option defines the default upload base.  When this is
              set to zero (disabled), all uploaded files will go into the
              user's currently selected file base.  If set to a non-zero
              value, all uploads will be uploaded to the set file base
              number (as listed in the file base editor).

              [N] Test Uploaded Files
              -----------------------
              Mystic BBS optionally supports external upload testing.  An
              upload processor is a program which will search a file for
              viruses and/or errors which may have occurred during the
              file transfer.  Any upload processor should work with Mystic
              but THD Pro Scan is recommended.  It's free and available
              on the Mystic BBS web page and support BBS.

              If this option is toggled to Yes, Mystic BBS will attempt to
              run the external processor after all uploaded files.

              [O] Pass Errorlevel
              -------------------
              This option defines the Errorlevel which is returned by the
              external file processor if the file has passed all testing
              successfully.  For more information, see the documentation
              included with the upload processor you wish to use.

              [P] Test Command Line
              ---------------------
              This option defines the command line which is used to run
              the external file processor.  The following MCI codes can
              be used with this command line:

                   %1 = Modem ComPort.
                   %2 = Modem Baud Rate.
                   %3 = Path and File Name of file to be tested.

              For more information, see the documentation included with
              the upload processor you wish to use.

          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          [E] Message Base Settings (System Configuration Editor)
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          The Message Base Settings section is where all options relating
          to the Message Base system are found.  Below is a screen capture
          of Message Base Settings screen following by an explanation of
          what each option does:

          Message Base Settings

          Command (Q/Quit):

              [A] Compress Area Numbers
              -------------------------
              This option, if toggled on, will compress message area numbers
              so they are always sequential during a message area list.  So
              in a message area list, if a user does not have access to area
              number 2, then the next area that the user does have access
              to will become area number 2.

              [B] Message Area List Columns
              -----------------------------
              This option allows the number of columns used in message base
              listings to be configured.  Valid options are 1 or 2 columns.
              Note: If you change the message area list to 1 from 2, you'll
              have to edit your message base list prompt to reflect a single
              column listing.

              [C] Max Auto Sig Lines
              ----------------------
              This option defines the maximum number of lines a user will
              be allowed to use in their auto signature.  An auto signature
              is a few lines of text which is automatically appended to
              each message a user posts.  Many users will use their auto
              signature to add their handle and e-mail address to each
              message.

              [D] Redisplay Message Header
              ----------------------------
              When this option is set to "Yes", Mystic will redisplay the
              message header after a page full of message text has been
              displayed.

              [E] QWK/REP File Name
              ---------------------
              Mystic BBS internally supports the QWK/REP offline mailing
              standard.  The QWK offline mailing system allows users to
              download messages from the BBS message base and read them
              offline using a QWK mail reader.  This allows the user to
              read and reply to mail offline when it's convenient to them,
              and also keeps the phone line free for other callers because
              the user will not be reading messages online.

              The QWK/REP filename is the name of the packet that
              Mystic BBS will create for the user when they select to
              download a QWK packet.  This file name should be unique to
              your BBS name so it doesn't get mixed up with packets
              downloaded from another BBS.

              [F] QWK Welcome File Name
              -------------------------
              Many QWK offline mail readers offer support to display files
              which are included with a QWK packet.  This option defines
              the filename which the QWK reader will display when the user
              first opens the packet for reading.

              [G] QWK News File Name
              ----------------------
              This option is used to define the file that will be displayed
              by the QWK offline reader as BBS news.

              [H] QWK Goodbye File Name
              -------------------------
              This option is used to define the file that will be displayed
              by the QWK offline reader when the user has finished reading
              the QWK packet.

              [I] Default Archive Extension
              -----------------------------
              This option is used to define the default archive which is
              used to compress QWK packets.  The extension should match
              the extension of any archives which have been setup in the
              Archive Editor.

              [J] QWK Max Msgs/Base
              ---------------------
              This option defines the maximum number of messages which
              can be packed into a QWK packet per message base.  This
              option is disabled if set to 0.

              [K] QWK Max Msgs/Packet
              -----------------------
              This option defines the maximum number of messages which
              can be packed into a QWK packet.  This option is disabled
              if set to 0.

              [L] Default Quote Color
              -----------------------
              This option is used to set the default display color for
              Quoted text while reading messages.  This color can also be
              configured for each individual message base in the Message
              Base Editor.

              [M] Default Text Color
              ----------------------
              This option is used to set the default display color for
              text while reading messages.  This color can also be
              configured for each individual message base in the Message
              Base Editor.

              [N] Default Tear Line Color
              ---------------------------
              This option is used to set the default display color for
              the Tear Line while reading messages.  This color can also
              be configured for each individual message base in the Message
              Base Editor.

              [O] Default Origin Line Color
              -----------------------------
              This option is used to set the default display color for
              the Origin line while reading messages.  This color can also
              be configured for each individual message base in the Message
              Base Editor.

          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          [F] Network Settings (System Configuration Editor)
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          The Network Settings option is used to setup Mystic BBS with
          message base networks such as FidoNet.  A Message Base network
          is a collection of BBSes that all share the same message bases,
          allowing users on a BBS in Europe (for example) to hold a
          discussion with users on a BBS in the United States.  For more
          information, see the section on interfacing with message
          networks.

          The following is a screen capture of the Network Settings screen
          followed by an explanation of what each option does:

          Network Settings

          1.   0:0/0                         2.   0:0/0
          3.   0:0/0                         4.   0:0/0
          5.   0:0/0                         6.   0:0/0
          7.   0:0/0                         8.   0:0/0
          9.   0:0/0                         10.  0:0/0
          11.  0:0/0                         12.  0:0/0
          13.  0:0/0                         14.  0:0/0
          15.  0:0/0                         16.  0:0/0
          17.  0:0/0                         18.  0:0/0
          19.  0:0/0                         20.  0:0/0

          A. Origin : Mystic BBS * (000)000-0000

          B. Netmail Crash : No
          C. Netmail Hold  : No
          D. Netmail Kill  : No

          Command (Q/Quit):

              [1 to 20] Network Addresses
              ---------------------------
              These options are used to setup Network addresses.  When a
              BBS joins a message network, it is assigned a network address
              which is used to identify the BBS.  Mystic BBS allows up to
              20 address definitions, meaning that Mystic BBS can
              be interfaced with up to 20 different message networks at
              once.

              [A] Default Origin Line
              -----------------------
              This option defines the default origin line which will be
              used for each message base.  This option can also be set
              for each individual message base in the Message Base Editor.

              An origin line is a line of text which is added at the
              bottom of each message posted into a networked message base.
              It is used to identify what BBS the message originated from
              as well as any other general information you wish to have
              supplied about your BBS (ie, phone number, modem speed, etc).

              [B] Netmail Crash
              -----------------
              When this option is set to "Yes", the CRASH flag will be set
              true on all outgoing Netmail messages.

              [C] Netmail Hold
              -----------------
              When this option is set to "Yes", the HOLD flag will be set
              true on all outgoing Netmail messages.

              [D] Netmail Kill
              -----------------
              When this option is set to "Yes", the KILL flag will be set
              true on all outgoing Netmail messages.


          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          [L] Language Definition Editor (System Configuration Editor)
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          About The Language System
          -------------------------
          The language definition editor is where all available language
          files are defined.  A language file is a file that contains
          all the text that is displayed to a user while they are online.
          These files can be edited with any text editor, or the language
          editor supplied with Mystic BBS (LANGEDIT.EXE).  By editing the
          language file, the user interface can be totally customized to
          your liking.  Almost 100% of the text displayed to the user
          can be customized using the MCI system and the display file
          system within the language files.  More information on editing
          language files can be found in the "Editing Language Files"
          section of the documentation.

          The following is a screen capture of the Language Editor
          screen followed by an explanation of each available option:

          Language Editor

          ##  FileName  Description
          --  --------  ------------------------------
          1   DEFAULT   Default

          (I)nsert, (D)elete, (E)dit, (Q)uit?

              [I] Insert Language
              -------------------
              This option is used to insert a new language file into the
              Language database.  Do not insert a new language file if it
              has not already been compiled.  If a user selects a language
              that doesn't have a compiled language file, they will
              receive an error message and Mystic BBS will then attempt to
              load the default language file, as defined in the System
              Configuration -> General Settings.

              [D] Delete Language
              -------------------
              This option is used to delete a language entry in the
              language editor.

              [E] Edit Language
              -----------------
              This option is used to edit the settings for a language
              entry.  When this option is selected, Mystic BBS will then
              allow the settings for the language file to be edited.  The
              following is a screen capture of the Edit screen followed
              by an explanation of what each option does:

              Language 1 of 1

              L. File Tag Character: 
              O. File Search Hi    : Test
              P. File Desc. Lo     : Test

              Command (Q/Quit):

              [A] Description
              ---------------
              This option holds the description of the language file.  The
              description is what the user will see when they are prompted
              to select a language file.

              [B] File Name
              -------------
              This option sets the file name of the compiled language file.
              The compiled language file must exist in the DATA directory
              in order for Mystic BBS to use the language.  Language files
              can be edited with LANGEDIT.EXE or a standard text editor, and
              are compiled with MAKELANG.EXE.  For more information, see the
              "Editing Language Files" section of the documentation.

              [C] Text Path
              -------------
              This option sets the directory where all display files for
              this language exist.  It is possible for language files to
              share the same text directory as other language files.

              [D] Menu Path
              -------------
              This option sets the directory where all system menu files
              for this language exist.  It is possible for language files
              to share the same menu directory as other language files.

              [E] Use Lightbar Y/N
              --------------------
              This option specifies if Mystic BBS will use lightbar Yes and
              No prompts for this language.  The user must have ANSI
              graphics to use any lightbar options.  If the user doesn't
              support ANSI and this option is turned on, Mystic BBS will
              ignore it and use standard prompts.

              [F] Y/N Highlight Yes
              ---------------------
              This is the text that is displayed in a Y/N lightbar prompt
              when the user has selected a Yes answer.

              [G] Y/N Highlight No
              --------------------
              This is the text that is displayed in a Y/N lightbar prompt
              when the user has selected a No answer.

              [H] Input Field Color
              ---------------------
              Throughout the BBS, Mystic will prompt the user using a
              colored input field.  The color of these input fields can be
              set here using standard DOS color numbers:

                   Foreground colors:
                   0 - Black         6 - Brown           12 - Light Red
                   1 - Blue          7 - Light Grey      13 - Light Magenta
                   2 - Green         8 - Dark Grey       14 - Yellow
                   3 - Cyan          9 - Light Blue      15 - White
                   4 - Red          10 - Light Green
                   5 - Magenta      11 - Light Cyan

                   Background colors:
                   0 - Black         4 - Red

                   2 - Green         6 - Brown
                   3 - Cyan          7 - Gray

              [I] Quote Bar Color
              -------------------
              This option defines the foreground and background colors of
              the lightbar used in the quote window of the full screen
              editor.  See option [H] for a reference to valid colors.

              [J] Echo Character
              ------------------
              This option defines the character that will be echoed in
              the input field when a password is being entered.

              [K] Input Character
              -------------------
              This option defines the character used to fill blank spaces
              during field input.  Here are some recommended settings for
              this option:

                   Ascii  32 ( )
                   Ascii 250 ()
                   Ascii 176 ()

              To enter any of these characters: Select option [K], hold in
              the ALT key, type the ASCII number on the keypad, then release
              the ALT key.

              [L] File Tag Character
              ----------------------
              This option defines the character used to mark a file as
              "tagged" into the lightbar file listings.  The suggested
              setting for this field is ASCII 251 (the  character).  Other
              lightbar file list options are defined within the ANSIFLST.XXX
              template file.

              [M] Allow ASCII Graphics
              ------------------------
              This option specifies whether or not this language definition
              will allow users in ASCII (no graphics) mode to use this
              language file.

              [N] Allow ANSI Graphics
              -----------------------
              This option specifies whether or not this language definition
              will allow users in ANSI (color graphics) mode to use this
              language file.

              * NOTE *
              These settings in the DEFAULT language file (as defined in
              System Configuration -> General Settings) are used to define
              which graphic modes your BBS will support.  For example,
              setting Allow ASCII to "No" in the default language file will
              force Mystic BBS to hangup on any callers using ASCII
              graphics.

              [O] File Search Hi
              ------------------
              This option defines the color of the highlighted text in
              the file description, when doing a file search.  See option
              [H] for a reference of available color combinations.

              [P] File Desc. Lo
              -----------------
              This option goes along with "File Search Hi".  It specifies
              the color of normal file description text, when doing a NON
              LIGHTBAR file listing.  See option [H] for a reference of
              available color combinations.

          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          [N] New User Settings (System Configuration Editor)
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          The New User Settings section is used to define how Mystic BBS
          will handle new callers who wish to create an account with the
          BBS.  The following is a screen capture of the New User Settings
          screen following by an explanation of what each option does:

          New User Settings

          Command (Q/Quit):

              [A] Allow New Users
              -------------------
              If this option is toggled off, Mystic BBS will not accept
              new user accounts.  Instead, the display file CLOSED.XXX
              will be displayed and the call will be terminated.

              [B] New User Password
              ---------------------
              This option is used to define a new user password.  If a
              password has been defined, a caller who attempts to log in
              as a new user will be prompted for the new user password
              before they will be able to continue to log in as a new
              user.

              [C] New User Security Level
              ---------------------------
              This option is used to set what security level a new user
              will be upgraded to after successfully completing the
              new user login procedure.  For more information on the
              security system, see the Security Level Editor section.

              [D] Ask Alias
              -------------

              for their Zip code.

              [I] Ask Home Phone
              ------------------
              If this option is set to Yes, Mystic BBS will ask new users
              for their home phone number.

              [J] Ask Data Phone
              ------------------

              [K] Ask Birthdate
              -----------------

              [L] Ask Gender
              --------------
              If this option is set to Yes, Mystic BBS will ask new users
              for their gender.

              [M] Use USA Phone Numbers
              -------------------------
              If this option is set to Yes, Mystic BBS will use USA format
              phone numbers (XXX-XXX-XXXX).

              [N] Date Format
              ---------------
              This option sets the date format which will be used for
              each user.  Valid options are MM/DD/YY, DD/MM/YY, YY/DD/MM,
              or Ask.  If this option is set to Ask, Mystic BBS will ask
              each new user which date format they'd like to use.

              [O] Language File
              -----------------
              This option is used to set which language file is used for
              new users.  Valid options are Use Default and Ask.  If set
              to Use Default, Mystic BBS will use the default language
              as defined in the General Settings section.  If set to Ask,
              Mystic BBS will ask the user which language they'd like to
              use.

              [P] Use Matrix Login
              --------------------
              This option defines whether Mystic BBS will use the Matrix
              login option.  The Matrix login is an alternative to the
              standard "Enter your name and password" login.  The Matrix
              system allows users to apply for an account and then when
              (if) they are validated, they receive a Matrix Password which
              is used to log into the BBS.

              [R] Matrix Menu Name
              --------------------
              This option defines the menu file name which is used as the
              Matrix Login menu.  This file must exist in order for the
              matrix login system to work properly.

              [S] Matrix Password
              -------------------
              This option defines the password which is given to the user
              after their account has been validated.  This is the password
              which the user will have to know in order to log into the BBS
              system from the Matrix Login menu.  If this field is left
              blank, the matrix password option will be disabled and the XL
              (Matrix Login) menu command will not require a password.

              [T] Matrix PW ACS
              -----------------
              This option defines the ACS level which the user must meet
              in order to be given the matrix login password from the matrix
              menu.

              [U] Editor
              ----------
              This option defines how the BBS will determine the new user's
              message editor preference.  Valid options are:

                   Line : New user's use the line editor by default.
                   Full : New user's use the full screen editor by default.
                   Ask  : Mystic BBS will ask the user their preference.

              [V] Sysop FeedBack
              ------------------
              This option defines if Mystic BBS will force new users to
              send an e-mail to the Sysop after creating a new user
              account.

              [W] File List Type
              ------------------
              This option defines how the BBS will determine the new user's
              file listing type.  Valid options are:

                   Normal   : Normal file listing.
                   Lightbar : Lightbar file listing.  This allows users
                              with ANSI graphics to scroll through the list
                              of files with arrow keys.
                   Ask      : Mystic BBS will ask the user their preference.

              [X] User Name Format
              --------------------
              This option specifies the way Mystic will handle new user's
              handle.  Valid options are:

                   As typed   : Mystic will leave the user handle as they
                                typed it.
                   Upper case : Mystic will convert the user's handle to
                                all uppercase letters.
                   Lower case : Mystic will convert the user's handle to
                                all lower case letters.
                   Proper     : Mystic will convert the first letter in
                                each word of the user's handle to a capital
                                letter, while forcing all other letters as
                                lower case.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Event Editor
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The event editor is where all system events are setup.  A system
     event is when Mystic BBS exits at a specified time so external
     programs can be ran to help maintain the BBS.  The following is a
     screen capture of the Event Editor screen followed by an explanation
     of what each option does:

     Event Editor

     ###  Name
     ---  ------------------------------
     -1   New Event

     (I)nsert, (D)elete, (E)dit, (Q)uit?

          [I] Insert Event
          ----------------
          The Insert option is used to add a new event into the event
          database.  After an event has been added, it should be setup
          to run as you want it to.

          [D] Delete Event
          ----------------
          The delete option is used to remove an event from the event
          database.

          [E] Edit Event
          --------------
          The edit option is used to edit an event already in the event
          database.  When this option is selected, the following screen
          will be shown:

          Event 1 of 1

          !. Active         : No
          A. Description    : New Event
          B. Forced         : No
          C. Errorlevel     : 0
          D. Execution Time : 00:00
          E. Busy Warning   : 0
          F. Last Ran on    : 00/00/80

          Command (Q/Quit):

              [!] Active Event
              ----------------
              This option sets if the event is active.  If the event is
              not set to active, Mystic BBS will ignore the event as if
              it doesn't even exist in the event database.

              [A] Description
              ---------------
              This option sets the description of the event.  This isn't
              internally used by Mystic BBS but is added to help keep
              track of which event does what.

              [B] Forced Event
              ----------------
              This option specifies if the event is a forced event.  A
              forced event will run at the execution time no matter what.
              the circumstances are.  If a user is online when a forced
              event approaches, they will be warned and then the call will
              be terminated if they do not log off by the execution time.
              If the event is not a forced event, Mystic BBS will wait until
              the user terminates their call before running the event.

              [C] Errorlevel
              --------------
              This option specifies the Errorlevel that Mystic BBS will
              exit at when this event is being ran.  This is used by the
              batch file which runs the BBS to determine which event is
              running.  For more information on Errorlevels and batch
              files, see the instruction manual for your operating system.

              [D] Execution Time
              ------------------
              This option is used to set what time Mystic BBS will run the
              event.  The time format is in 24-hour format.  For example,
              12:00 is 12 noon, and 23:59 would be 11:59pm.

              [E] Busy Warning
              ----------------
              The busy warning option is used to set when Mystic BBS will
              warn the user of an upcoming event.  So if this option is
              set to 5, Mystic BBS will wait until 5 minutes before the
              event to warn the user.  If the event is not a forced event
              then Mystic BBS does not run the event until the user logs
              off, and this option will be ignored.

              [F] Last Ran On
              ---------------
              This option is used to show the date when the event was last
              ran.  In most cases, this option does not need to be touched
              as Mystic BBS keeps this field up-to-date each time the
              event is ran.


     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Archive Editor
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The archive editor is where all archive compression and decompression
     utilities are setup.  Archive utilities are programs which take a
     number of files and compress them into one file, saving drive space
     and in the case of a BBS, file transfer time.  Archive utilities are
     used with Mystic BBS in the file transfer functions, and in the QWK
     offline mail functions and are almost required if you want to use
     these features.

     Some popular archive programs are:

         - PkWare's PKZIP utilities              ARJ241A.EXE
         - Robert Jung's ARJ utilities           PKZ204G.EXE
         - Eugene Roshal's RAR utilities         RAR202.EXE
         - Haruyasu Yoshizaki's LHA utilities    LHA225.EXE

     These utilities can be found on most BBSes and throughout the
     Internet.  Many are free for non-commercial use.

     Below is a screen capture of the Archive Editor followed by an
     explanation of what each option does:

          Archive Editor

          [D] Delete Archive
          ------------------
          This option is used to delete an archive definition from the
          archive editor.

          [E] Edit Archive
          ----------------
          This option is used to edit an archive definition in the
          archive editor.  Below is a screen capture of the Archive
          Settings screen followed by an explanation of what each option
          does:

              Archive 1 of 4

              A. Name      : PkWare's ZIP
              B. Extension : ZIP
              C. Pack Cmd  : PKZIP -a -ex -o %1 %2
              D. Unpack Cmd: PKUNZIP -o -ed %1 %2 %3
              E. View Cmd  : PKUNZIP -vb %1 >%3%2

              Command (Q/Quit):

              [A] Archive Name
              ----------------
              This option defines the description of the archive as it
              will appear when listed by Mystic BBS.

              [B] Archive Extension
              ---------------------
              This option defines the archive extension as created by the
              archive utility which is currently being setup.

              [C] Pack Command Line
              ---------------------
              This option defines the command line that Mystic BBS uses
              to pack a group of files into one file.  Archive MCI codes
              must be used for this command line and are listed below.

              [D] Unpack Command Line
              -----------------------
              This option defines the command line that Mystic BBS uses
              to unpack an archive into the temporary directory.  Archive
              MCI codes must be used for this command line and are listed
              below.

              [E] View Command Line
              ---------------------
              This option defines the command line that Mystic BBS uses
              to view the contents of an archive.  Mystic BBS internally
              supports the viewing of ZIP, LZH, ARJ, and RAR files.  If an
              archive is not of one of the above types, Mystic BBS will
              look into the archive definitions and use the this command
              line to view if the extension of the file matches the
              extension of the archive definition.

          Archive MCI Codes
          -----------------
          These codes work just like the MCI display codes, but only work
          with the archive definitions.  The following MCI codes can be
          used in the Archive Editor:

          %1 = File name being processed.
          %2 = Files to pack/unpack.
          %3 = Temporary file directory where Mystic BBS packs/unpacks
               archives.


     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Protocol Editor (Editing File Transfer Protocols)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The protocol editor is where all file transfer protocols are setup
     and maintained.  A file transfer protocol is a program which is used
     to transfer files between computer systems.  In almost all cases they
     are needed if you wish to run a BBS, unless you don't plan on using
     the entire file transfer section or any of the QWK offline mailing
     functions.

     By default, Mystic BBS comes pre-configured to use the CEXYZ v1.00
     protocol driver.  This archive can be found on the Mystic BBS web page
     as well as on various BBS systems under the filename of CEXYZ100.XXX
     (where XXX is the archive type).  In most cases, you should only need
     to copy the CEXYZ.EXE file into the protocol directory as defined in
     the System Configuration -> System Paths in order to have a fully
     working protocol setup.  If you wish to use a protocol driver other
     than CEXYZ, you must make sure that it is capable of producing a
     compatible DSZ-style log file.

     Below is a screen capture of the Protocol Editor screen followed by
     an explanation of what each option does:

         Protocol Editor

         ##  Key  Description
         --  ---  --------------------
         1    X   (CEXYZ) Xmodem
         2    Y   (CEXYZ) Ymodem
         3    Y   (CEXYZ) Ymodem Batch
         4    G   (CEXYZ) Ymodem-G
         5    G   (CEXYZ) Ymodem-G Batch
         6    Z   (CEXYZ) Zmodem
         7    Z   (CEXYZ) Zmodem Batch

        (I)nsert, (D)elete, (E)dit, (Q)uit?

        [I] Insert Protocol
        -------------------
        This option will add a new protocol definition to the protocol
        editor.

        [D] Delete Protocol
        -------------------
        This option will allow an existing protocol definition to be
        deleted from the protocol editor.

        [E] Edit Protocol
        -----------------
        This option allows an existing protocol definition to be edited.
        The following is a screen capture of the Protocol Editor EDIT
        screen followed by an explanation of each option:

              Protocol 6 of 7

              A. Key        : Z
              B. Description: (CEXYZ) Zmodem
              C. Batch      : No
              D. UL Command : cexyz.exe /P%1 /B%2 /L%4 /Rz %3
              E. DL Command : cexyz.exe /P%1 /B%2 /L%4 /Sz %3

              Command (Q/Quit):

              [A] Key
              -------
              This option specifies the hotkey which is used to select
              this protocol from the protocol list.  It is important to
              make sure that a protocol definition does not use the same
              hotkey as another protocol definition, or problems may
              occur.

              [B] Description
              ---------------
              This option defines the name / description of the protocol as
              it will appear when a user is prompted to select a protocol.

              [C] Batch
              ---------
              This option defines if this protocol is a batch protocol.  A
              batch protocol is a protocol which allows a group of files
              to be sent at one time, consecutively.  If a user has flagged
              a list of files to download at one time, Mystic BBS will
              prompt them to select a BATCH protocol.  If a user has
              selected only one file to download, Mystic BBS will prompt the
              user to select a non-batch protocol.  Note that some protocols
              allow both single and batch file transfers, so there might be
              two definitions on the protocol editor for one protocol.  One
              being the setup for single file transfers, and one being the
              setup for batch file transfers.

              [D] Upload Command Line
              -----------------------
              This option specifies the command line that is sent to the
              protocol driver in order to upload (receive) files from
              another connection.  There is a specific set of MCI codes
              which can be used in the protocol editor only listed below.

              [E] Download Command Line
              -------------------------
              This option specifies the command line that is sent to the
              protocol driver in order to download (send files FROM the BBS)
              to a connected user.  The MCI codes available only to the
              protocol editor are listed below:

              PROTOCOL SPECIFIC MCI CODES:

                   %0 = Comport handle (Win32 and OS/2 only)
                   %1 = Comport which the modem is using.
                   %2 = The baud rate the user is currently connected at.
                   %3 = Name of the file being transferred.
                   %4 = Baud rate as setup in the Node settings (locked).

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Message Base Editor (Editing Message Bases)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The message base system allows users to post messages which can be
     publicly read by anyone, or sent privately to an individual user.
     Mystic also supports to option of having "networked" message bases,
     meaning, a message base which is shared with several other BBS
     systems, allowing all users from every system to send messages to
     each other!  The following is a screen capture of the Message Base
     Editor along with a description of each available option:

     Message Base 1 of 3

     A. Name         : General Messages
     B. QWK Name     : General Msgs
     C. Filename     : GENERAL
     D. Storage Path : D:\TP\MYSTIC\MSGS\
     E. Post Type    : Public                    Y. Format Type  : JAM

     F. List ACS     : s10                       O. Quote Color  : XX> Quote
     G. Read ACS     : s10                       P. Text Color   : Text
     H. Post ACS     : s10                       R. Tear Color   : --- Tear
     I. Sysop ACS    : s255                      S. Origin Color : * Origin:
     J. Password     :                           T. Header File  :
     K. Base Type    : Local
     L. Net Address  : 0:0/0
     M. Origin line  : My BBS * (000)000-0000
     N. Use Realnames: No

     U. Default New Scan: Yes                    W. Max Messages : 0
     V. Default QWK Scan: Yes                    X. Max Msg Age  : 0 days

     ([) Prev, (]) Next, (Q)uit:

          [A] Message Base Name
          ---------------------
          This option defines the message base name, as it will appear in the
          list of available message bases.

          [B] QWK Message Base Name
          -------------------------
          This option defines the QWK message base name.  This name will be
          used as the message base name within a user's QWK offline mail
          packet.

          [C] Storage File Name
          ---------------------
          This option defines the file name which Mystic will use to store
          the message base data in.  This should be a unique name, up to
          8 characters in length.

          [D] Storage Path
          ----------------

          This option is used to specify the path on your hard disk that
          Mystic BBS will use to store data files for this message base.
          Mystic will automatically assign the "default" message base path
          to this option, and in most cases it does not need to be changed.

          [E] Post Type
          -------------
          This option sets the "type" of message that is allowed to be posted
          in this base.  Available options are:

               1) Public  : All messages are posted as public and can be read
                            by all users.
               2) Private : All messages are posted as private and can ONLY be
                            read by the user it is sent to.

          [F] List ACS
          ------------
          This option defines the Access String (ACS) which the user must meet
          in order for this base to appear in the message base listing.

          [G] Read ACS
          ------------
          This option defines the ACS string which the user must meet in order
          to read messages in this base.

          [H] Post ACS
          ------------
          This option defines the ACS string which the user must meet in order
          to post a message into this base.

          [I] SysOp ACS
          -------------
          This option defines the ACS string which the user must meet in order
          to access "SysOp" functions for this message base.  Functions such
          as editing the message header and text, along with (X)porting the
          message to a text file.

          [J] Password
          ------------
          This option defines the password required to access this message
          base.  If this option is left blank, no password will be required.

          [K] Base Type
          -------------
          This option defines the "type" of message base that is being setup.
          Available options are:

               Local   : Sets the message base as a local base.  This means
                         that this base is NOT part of any message network
                         where messages need to be exported, processed, and
                         sent to another system.

               EchoMail: Sets the message base as a EchoMail message base.
                         Most message base networks available to BBS SysOps
                         are "FidoNet" style echomail networks.  This
                         option causes Mystic to exit with an errorlevel of
                         5 when new Echomail mail has been entered.  This
                         allows for your setup to execute the appropriate
                         Echomail mail processors.

               UseNet  : Sets the message base as a UseNet message base. This
                         option is for easier integration with the Internet
                         UseNet newsgroups.  This option works much like a
                         Echomail base, except it causes Mystic to exit with
                         errorlevel 6 when new messages have been entered and
                         it automatically sets all messages "To: ALL".

               NetMail : Sets the message base as an EchoMail / NetMail base.
                         When a base is set as NetMail, Mystic will also ask
                         for an echomail destination address along with the
                         "To" field.

          NOTE: When both Echomail and UseNet mail have been entered,
                Mystic will exit with an errorlevel of 7.  When this occurs,
                both Echomail and UseNet mail processors should be executed.

          [L] Network Address
          -------------------
          This option defines the FidoNet network address, which is assigned
          to each BBS in a message base network.

          [M] Origin Line
          ---------------
          This option defines the Origin Line which is appended to each
          message posted in aa Echomail message base.  The origin line usually
          contains the name or your BBS, the phone number, location, telnet
          address, etc.

          [N] Use Real Names
          ------------------
          This option defines whether Mystic will use the user's REAL name
          in the "From" field.  Some message base networks require that all
          message posted use the user's real name.

          [O] Quote Color
          ---------------
          This option specifies the color Mystic will use for "quoted" text
          when reading messages.  Available colors options are:

               Foreground colors:
               0 - Black         6 - Brown           12 - Light Red
               1 - Blue          7 - Light Grey      13 - Light Magenta
               2 - Green         8 - Dark Grey       14 - Yellow
               3 - Cyan          9 - Light Blue      15 - White
               4 - Red          10 - Light Green
               5 - Magenta      11 - Light Cyan

               Background colors:
               0 - Black         4 - Red
               1 - Blue          5 - Magenta
               2 - Green         6 - Brown
               3 - Cyan          7 - Gray

          [P] Text Color
          --------------
          This option defines the color Mystic will use to display "regular"
          text while a user is reading a message.

          [R] Tear Color
          --------------
          This option defines the color Mystic will use to display the tear
          line of the message.  The tear line is a line of text usually
          appended at the end of a networked message base.  For example, at
          the end of each exported message, Mystic will append the following
          tear and origin line:

               --- Mystic BBS v1.03/DOS
                * Origin: <your configured origin here> (0:0/0)

          [S] Origin Color
          ----------------
          This option defines the color Mystic will use to display the origin
          line of the message.

          [T] Message Header File
          -----------------------
          This option defines the optional external message header which can
          be used.  The filename specified here should be found in the TEXT
          directory with all of the other display files.  If this file does
          not exist, Mystic will generate it's own message header.  The
          following PromptInfo MCI codes are available in the message header
          file:

               |&1  From                |&6  Total messages in base
               |&2  To                  |&7  Reply to message number
               |&3  Subject             |&8  See also message number
               |&4  Message Date        |&9  Message status
               |&5  Message number      |&0  Message Time

          [U] Default New Scan
          --------------------
          This option defines if the message base will be toggled ON in
          all users new message scan settings by default.

          [V] Default QWK Scan
          --------------------
          This option defines if the message base will be toggled ON in
          all users QWK message scan settings by default.

          [W] Max Messages
          ----------------
          This option specifies the maximum number of messages which this
          base can contain before they will be purged.  Mystic does not
          internally do anything with these values.  They have been added
          to support the Squish message base standard and their utilities.

          [X] Max Message Age
          -------------------
          This option specifies the maximum days a message can be posted
          before they will be purged.  Mystic does not internally do anything
          with these values.  They have been added to support the Squish
          message base standard and their utilities.

          [Y] Format Type
          ---------------
          This option specifies the message base "format" to use.  This
          can be set to either "JAM" or "Squish", the two most popular
          message base formats.

          *NOTE: If you have an active message base in one format, and wish
                 to change to another format, you will need to do one of two
                 things:

                    1) Delete the message base data files, and lose the
                       current messages in the base, or...
                    2) Run a utility to convert from one format to the other
                       THEN switch formats in the message base editor.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     File Base Editor (Editing File Bases)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The file base system allows users to transfer files to and from the
     BBS system so they can be shared with other users of the BBS.  These
     files can be categorized into different file bases, which are setup
     in the File Base Editor.  The following is a screen capture of the
     file base editor screen along with a description of each available
     option:

         File Board Editor

         ###  Name
         ---  --------------------------
         1    New File Base

         (I)nsert, (D)elete, (E)dit, (M)ove, (Q)uit?

         [I] Insert File Base
         --------------------
         This option allows a new file base definition to be added into
         the database.

         [D] Delete File Base
         --------------------
         This option allows an already defined file base to be removed
         from the file base database.

         [M] Move File Base
         ------------------
         This option allows already defined file bases to be moved around
         within the database.

         [E] Edit File Base
         ------------------
         This option allows the settings for an already defined file base
         to be edited.  The following is a screen capture of the file base
         modify screen along with an explanation of what each option does:

     System Display Files
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Display files are displayed at certain times while a user is online.
     These files exist in the TEXT directory and have an extension of
     either .ANS or .ASC.  If you wish to have your BBS use .ANS files
     (files which make use of ANSI color and graphics), then it is
     suggested that you use an ANSI paint program such as TheDraw to create
     such files.

     .ANS files: These are files which contain ANSI color and graphic codes.
                 They are displayed if the user supports the ANSI graphics
                 standard.

     .ASC files: These are files which contain only straight ASCII
                 characters.  They are displayed if the user does not
                 support ANSI graphics, OR if the user does support ANSI
                 graphics but only a display file with the extension .ASC
                 exists in the text directory.

     Below is a list of all system display files and when they are
     displayed (where .XXX is either .ANS or .ASC):

     Random Display Files
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Mystic BBS supports randomly selected display files.  If you have
     several different versions of a single display file, it is possible
     to have Mystic BBS randomly select and display one of the files.

     Here's how the random display system works:  Mystic BBS will check to
     see if the extension of the file with the last letter replaced by a
     "1" exists.  If the display file name is TEMP.ASC, Mystic will look to
     see if TEMP.AS1 exists.  If it does, Mystic will search for all files
     which follow the TEST.AS? file mask (where ? is replaced by a 1
     through 9).  Mystic will then randomly select one of the files and
     display it.

     For example:  If the display file name is TEST.ASC and the TEST.AS1
     file exists, Mystic BBS will randomly select and display any one of the
     following files that exist:

         TEST.ASC
         TEST.AS1
         TEST.AS2
         TEST.AS4
         TEST.AS5
         TEST.AS6
         TEST.AS7
         TEST.AS8
         TEST.AS9

     The same format works for all display files, so if the file name is
     TEST.ANS, and TEST.AN1 exists, Mystic will randomly select and display
     any one of the following files that exist:

         TEST.ANS
         TEST.AN1
         TEST.AN2
         TEST.AN3
         TEST.AN4
         TEST.AN5
         TEST.AN6
         TEST.AN7
         TEST.AN8
         TEST.AN9

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     MCI Display Codes
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     MCI codes are used to display various information about the BBS system
     or the currently logged in user.  They can be used in all prompts and
     display files throughout Mystic BBS, and are in the format of |XX
     (where XX is replaced by any one of the codes listed below).  The
     following is an example of using the MCI system in a display file:

          Original text:
          --------------
          Welcome to this BBS, |UN.

          You have called |CS times total.
          You have called |CT times today.

          When displayed by Mystic:
          -------------------------

     Available MCI Codes
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Codes 00 through 15 can be used to set the foreground color:

          00 - Black foreground.
          01 - Dark blue foreground.
          02 - Dark green foreground.
          03 - Dark cyan foreground.
          04 - Dark red foreground.
          05 - Dark magenta foreground.
          06 - Dark yellow foreground.
          07 - Light gray foreground.
          08 - Dark gray foreground.
          09 - Light blue foreground.
          10 - Light green foreground.
          11 - Light cyan foreground.
          12 - Light red foreground.
          13 - Light magenta foreground.
          14 - Light yellow foreground.
          15 - White foreground.

     Codes 16 through 23 can be used to set the background color:

          16 - Black background.
          17 - Blue background.
          18 - Green background.
          19 - Cyan background.
          20 - Red background.
          21 - Magenta background.
          22 - Yellow background.
          23 - Grey background.

     The following three MCI codes are used to set how the next displayed
     MCI code is formatted:

          $Rxx - Pads the next MCI code to the right with spaces.  Where
                 xx is the number of spaces to pad.  It must ALWAYS be
                 two characters, so if you want to pad an MCI to 5 spaces,
                 you MUST enter |$R05, not |$R5.
          $Lxx - Pads the next MCI code to the left xx spaces.
          $Cxx - Pads the next MCI code to the center.  Where xx is the
                 number of spaces to center the MCI within.

          The following MCI code is used to duplicate a character a
          specified number of times:

          $Dxxy - Duplicates the character y, xx number of times.

     Here are some examples of using MCI formatting:

          Original text:
          --------------
          |$R30|UNHello

          |$D20*

          When displayed by Mystic:
          -------------------------
          Hello
          ********************

     The following MCI codes are used to move the cursor to a specified
     position on the screen.  They will only work if the user is capable
     of supporting ANSI graphics, otherwise they will be ignored:

          [Xxx - Moves the cursor to column XX.
          [Yxx - Moves the cursor to row XX.

          [Axx - Moves the cursor XX rows UP
          [Bxx - Moves the cursor XX rows DOWN
          [Cxx - Moves the cursor XX rows RIGHT
          [Dxx - Moves the cursor XX rows LEFT

     Codes &0 through &9 are used in the language file and hold different
     values for different display strings.  They are called Prompt Info
     MCI codes.  The supported prompt info codes for each string are
     listed in the language file and the language editor (LANGEDIT.EXE).

     Codes !0 through !9 are used with the template system and are called
     Screen Info MCI codes.  They are usually used to define screen
     coordinates in each template file.  For more information on these
     MCI codes and the template system, see the section on the Mystic BBS
     Template System.

     The following MCI codes are used to display information on the BBS
     and the currently logged in user:

          AS - Is user's auto signature toggled ON?  (Returns YES or NO)
          AV - Is the user available to receive node messages (YES or NO)
          BD - Displays the user's baud rate.

               For example, |DFHELLO would display the text file
               HELLO.XXX from the currently language text file directory.
               Mystic BBS assumes all of the remaining text on a
               line after a DF code as the file name to display.

     Template System (Editing Mystic BBS Templates)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The template system is used to customize the display of many options
     of Mystic BBS which are not part of the language system.  Template
     files are more or less "screen captures" of the screen that will be
     displayed to the user, with Screen Info MCI codes inserted to define
     the X and Y screen coordinates for various things.  These files MUST
     exist in the text directory for each language in order for Mystic BBS
     to function properly.  The default installation for Mystic BBS
     includes these files, but they can be edited if the default files are
     not satisfactory.

     The following is a list of template files which Mystic BBS requires,
     and a description of where they are used:

          ANSICHAT.XXX  : Split screen chat template.
          ANSIEDIT.XXX  : Full screen editor template.
          ANSIFINF.XXX  : Lightbar file listing: extended file information.
          ANSIFLST.XXX  : Lightbar file listing template.
          ANSIMLST.XXX  : Lightbar message reading index.
          ANSIMRD .XXX  : Lightbar message reader.
          ANSIQUOT.XXX  : Full screen editor quote mode template.
          ANSITEXT.XXX  : Full screen TEXT editor template.

     The template system can be confusing for someone who doesn't have much
     experience with ANSI text file editing.  In most cases, it is
     suggested that the ANSI file editor "TheDraw" be used, and that the
     files are saved as ANSI animated files.  If you are not familiar with
     editing ANSI files then it is suggested that you do not edit the
     default templates, or at least make a backup of the default templates
     before attempting to modify them.

     The following is a small section on each template file, with
     instructions on how each one is used:

          -----------------------------------------
          ANSICHAT.XXX - Split Screen Chat Template
          -----------------------------------------

          The ANSICHAT.XXX template is used when the split screen chat mode
          is activated.  Screen Info MCI codes are used in this template to
          specify the coordinates of both the sysop and user chat window.
          The following is a list of the MCI codes used in this template
          followed by an explanation of where each one should be used:

          |!1  Specifies the upper Y position of the user's window and the
               text color of the user's window.
          |!2  Specifies the lower Y position of the user's window
          |!3  Specifies the left  X position of the user's window
          |!4  Specifies the right X position of the user's window

          |!5  Specifies the upper Y position of the sysop's window and the
               text color of the user's window.
          |!6  Specifies the lower Y position of the sysop's window
          |!7  Specifies the left  X position of the sysop's window
          |!8  Specifies the right X position of the sysop's window

          |!9  Specifies the color/location of time left update
          |!0  Specifies the color/location of system time update

          |&1  Replaced with the user's name.
          |&2  Replaced with the sysop's name.

          An example of a split screen chat template would be:

                   User: |&1
                   -----------------------------
                   |!1
                   |!3                         |!4
                   |!2
                   Sysop: |&2
                   -----------------------------
                   |!5
                   |!7                         |!8
                   |!6
                   -----------------------------

          ------------------------------------------
          ANSIEDIT.XXX - Full Screen Editor Template
          ------------------------------------------

          The ANSIEDIT.XXX template is used when the full screen editor is
          activated.  Screen Info MCI codes are used in this file to define
          the coordinates of the text editing window.  The following list of
          MCI codes are used in the Full Screen Editor template:

          |!1  Specifies the top line of the edit window, as well as the
               color of the inputted text.
          |!2  Specifies the bottom line of the edit window.
          |!3  Specifies the location of the "INS/OVR" toggle, as well as
               the color of the "INS/OVR" text.
          |&1  Who the message is To
          |&2  Subject of the message

          An example of a full screen editor template:

                   Full Screen Editor   [|!3]   Ctrl-Z = Help
                   ------------------------------------------
                   |!1



                   |!2
                   ------------------------------------------

          Note: The color which is set after the template is displayed
          will be the color of the edited text.

          See also: ANSIQUOT.XXX.  The template for the Full Screen Editor
          Quote window.

          -------------------------------------------------------
          ANSIFINF.XXX - Extended File Info In Lightbar File List
          -------------------------------------------------------

          This template is used when displaying extended information on
          a file during the lightbar file listings.  The following
          screen info and prompt info MCI codes are available:

          |&1  File name of the file.
          |&2  File size of the file.
          |&3  Date the file was added into the database.

          |&7  Estimated seconds it will take to transfer the file.
          |&8  Name of the user who uploaded the file.

          |!1  Specifies the color and top Y position of the file description
               window.
          |!2  Specifies the bottom Y position of the file description
               window.

          ---------------------------------------------
          ANSIFLST.XXX - Lightbar File Listing Template
          ---------------------------------------------

          The ANSIFLST.XXX template is used to define the coordinates and
          colors for the lightbar file listings.  The color of each screen
          info MCI code for this template is saved, and will be used in the
          file listing.  The following screen info MCI codes are used:

          |!1  Specifies the top Y coordinate of the file list window.  The
               color of this code is ignored.
          |!2  Specifies the bottom Y coordinate of the file list window.
               The color of this code is ignored.
          |!3  Specifies the Y coordinate and default color for the "prompt"
               line.  This is the line where general text is displayed, such
               as "Batch queue full", etc.
          |!4  This code is optional, and if defined specifies the X/Y
               coordinates AND the color of the total number of files in
               the user's batch queue.

          ---------------------------------------------
          ANSIMLST.XXX - Lightbar Message Reading Index
          ---------------------------------------------

          |!1  Specifies the top line of the message index list window
          |!2  Specifies the bottom line of the message index window
          |!3  Specifies the line Mystic will relocate to when the user
               selects to quit reading.

          -------------------------------------
          ANSIMRD.XXX - Lightbar Message Reader
          -------------------------------------

          The ANSIMRD.XXX template is used when the user is reading actual
          messages and has the lightbar message reader toggled ON.


          ------------------------------------------------
          ANSIQUOT.XXX - Full Screen Editor Quote Template
          ------------------------------------------------

          The ANSIQUOT.XXX template file is used to define the quote window
          used in the full screen editor.  The quote window is always six
          lines in size, so when creating the ANSIQUOT.XXX, you must make
          sure that there are at least 6 lines from the beginning of the
          quote window to the end of the screen.  The following is a list of
          MCI codes which are used for this template:

          |!1  This defines the position where text scroll at while quoting.
               This is usually the line before the quote window starts.
          |!2  This is the line where the actual first line of the quote
               window is.  The bottom line is not needed since the quote
               window is always 6 lines long.  The color of this code is
               saved and is used for non-highlighted text.

          An example of the quote template:

                   <top of screen>


                   |!1
                   --Quote Window (ESC) Quit----------------
                   |!2

                   <bottom of screen>

          The color for the Quote Window Lightbar can be defined in the
          System Configuration -> Language Editor section of the BBS.

          -----------------------------------------------
          ANSITEXT.XXX - Full Screen Text Editor Template
          -----------------------------------------------

          This template file is identical to the ANSIEDIT.XXX file except
          that it is used when editing text, and not inputting a message.
          Ctrl-Z in the text editor SAVES the text, instead of showing the
          help screen as the full screen editor does.  The &1 and &2 MCI
          codes are not available for this template.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Installing Multiple Nodes of Mystic BBS
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Mystic BBS is a multi-node BBS package.  This means that multiple
     incoming connections can be installed - whether they be dial-up or
     telnet connections.  Mystic BBS will allow up to 255 nodes to be

     Setting up Mystic BBS to run multi-node is VERY easy.  You will not
     have to change your setup in any way, or create directories and copy
     files or anything like that.  All you will need is a multi-tasker, or
     an operating system that has built in multi-tasking capabilities.

     Mystic BBS internally supports to following multi-tasking software and
     operating systems:

         - Quarterdeck's DesqView (DOS)
         - Microsoft Windows (any version)
         - IBM OS/2 (any version)

     In addition, Mystic BBS will give off "generic" time slicing if one of
     the above environments is not detected.  This means that Mystic BBS will
     run well under almost ANY obscure multi-tasker!

     Mystic BBS has been tested and ran under the following operating
     systems.  Mystic may run well in other configurations, but the following
     have been tested and said to work well:

         - DOS using DesqView
         - Windows 3.1
         - Windows 95
         - Windows 98
         - Windows NT
         - IBM OS/2 Warp 3.0
         - IBM OS/2 Warp 4.0
         - Linux (using DOSEMU)

     How to setup Mystic BBS to run Multi-node:

         (1) Load Mystic BBS and enter "System Configuration".  From there
             select "General Settings".  Set the "Max # of Nodes" option
             to the maximum number of incoming nodes that you plan on
             loading.  Exit Mystic BBS.

         (2) Load EACH node you wish to setup in local mode.  This can be
             done by running Mystic BBS with the -Nx and -L command lines.
             For example, the command line for loading node 2 in local mode
             would be: "-N2 -L".

             Enter "System Configuration" and select "Modem/Node Settings".
             You will need to setup each node so it finds the correct modem.

     You're done!  That's it.  The only difference in your setup will be
     that you MUST specify the node number now when loading your BBS. This
     is done with the "-N" command line option.

     So loading your BBS would work something like this:

          (1) Create new DOS task.
          (2) Load Mystic BBS with -Nx option.
          (3) Repeat for each node.

     I hope this is all understandable.  It really is VERY easy to do - it
     takes me about 3 minutes to get a new node setup and running!

     Setting Up Mystic BBS (DOS Version) To Allow Incoming Telnet
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Mystic requires the use of a virtual modem driver, such as NetModem
     for Windows, or Ray Gwinn's SIO drivers for OS/2.  More information
     will be added to this section in the future.

     MBBSUTIL.EXE: Mystic BBS External Utilities
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Mystic BBS comes along with an external utilities program found in the
     root Mystic BBS directory under the filename of MBBSUTIL.EXE.  This
     program provides many utilities which can (and should) be ran
     occasionally to help keep your Mystic BBS system running smoothly.

     When MBBSUTIL.EXE is ran, there are several command line options
     available which command MBBSUTIL.EXE what to do.  The follow is a list
     of the available commands, and a brief description of what each option
     does:

         -BKILL <ID> <Days> : This command will remove all BBS list entries
                              which haven't been verified in the past <Days>
                              days.  The <ID> option specifies the BBS list
                              ID name, as required by Mystic's BBS listing
                              menu commands.  If <ID> is set to "ALL",
                              MBBSUTIL will check ALL existing BBS lists.

         -BPACK             : This command will pack the BBS list database.
                              It will remove any records which have been
                              marked as deleted from the data files.

         -BSORT <ID> <Type> : This command will sort a BBS list, and also
                              pack it while sorting!  The <ID> option
                              specifies the BBS list ID name, as required
                              by Mystic's BBS listing menu commands.  If
                              <ID> is set to "ALL", MBBSUTIL will sort all
                              existing BBS lists.

                              The <TYPE> option specifies the data which
                              MBBSUTIL will use to sort the list.  The
                              following options are available:

                                 BBSNAME  : Sort by BBS name
                                 LOCATION : Sort by Location
                                 PHONE    : Sort by phone number
                                 TELNET   : Sort by telnet address

         -FCHECK            : This command will check all file entries in all
                              file bases to make sure that the file physically
                              exists.  If the file does not exist, or if the
                              size of the file is 0 bytes, MBBSUTIL will mark
                              the file as offline.  Likewise, if a file marked
                              as offline physically exists, MBBSUTIL will
                              remove it's offline flag.  The FCHECK command
                              will also validate the file size of each file
                              entry.

         -FPACK             : This command will pack the file database.  It
                              will remove any files which have been marked as
                              deleted from the data files.

         -FSORT             : This command will sort the file database in
                              alphabetical order by filename.  It will also
                              automatically pack the file base while sorting!

         -UKILL <Days>      : This command will delete users who have not called
                              the BBS for a specified number of <days>.  The
                              <days> option must be at least 5.  This will
                              prevent accidentally having a 0 wipe out the
                              entire user database.

         -UPACK             : This command will pack the user file.  It will
                              remove any user accounts which have been marked
                              as deleted from the user data files.

     It is suggested that all of the "packing" functions (-BPACK, -FPACK,
     -UPACK, etc) are ran at least once every few days, maybe more or less
     depending on how active your BBS is.  The sorting functions are less
     important, but they are nice to help keep your BBS organized.  An
     example command line for running MBBSUTIL.EXE with all the suggested
     commands follows:

         MBBSUTIL.EXE -BPACK -FPACK -UPACK

     Note: Since MBBSUTIL.EXE makes modifications to the system data files,
     it should only be ran when there are NO users currently logged into
     the BBS system.  MBBSUTIL.EXE will attempt to detect if any users are
     logged into the system, and if so, it will refuse to run.

     MIDE.EXE and MPLC.EXE: Mystic BBS Programming Executable Compilers
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Mystic BBS has a built in programming language which can be used to
     create add-on games and utilities for your BBS.  Two programs are
     supplied with Mystic BBS which go along with this programming
     language:

         MPLC.EXE - A command line compiler.  This program translates a
                    MPS source file into a MPE binary executable file.  A
                    MPS source file is a text file which contains programming
                    commands recognized by the MPE engine.  These files can
                    be edited with any text editor, or the supplied MIDE
                    program described below.

         MIDE.EXE - MIDE is the Mystic BBS Integrated Development
                    Environment.  In other words, its a text editor which
                    helps you to create MPE programs.  This program allows
                    MPS source files to be edited and compiled, while
                    offering some other features that a normal text editor
                    does not.

     For more information on the MPE language, see MPL.DOC located in the
     scripts directory.  This file will reference all the programming
     commands supported by the MPE engine.  You may also wish to look at
     the various .MPS files in the script directory for examples of fully
     functional programs.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     System Error Codes (Runtime Errors)
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     If an error happens while Mystic BBS is running, it will return an
     error message to the user, and terminate the call.  In the log
     file, an error number will be logged.  Below is a list of what each
     of those error numbers stand for.  They are provided for reference
     only, and will probably not be of any help to a Sysop.
