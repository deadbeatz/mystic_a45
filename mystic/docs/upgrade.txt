| UPGRADING MYSTIC BBS |------------------------------------------------------
`----------------------'

 1. FIRST and ALWAYS create a backup of your BBS before upgrading.  Generally
    upgrading goes pretty smooth, but there is always the chance of something
    going wrong whether it is Mystic or operator error!

 2. There is no automatic upgrade process.  The process is to install the full
    installation to a temporary directory, so that you have access to the
    latest version of the files.  Then follow the upgrade instructions provided
    below for your specific version.  Usually this just means replacing new
    binary files contained in the new alpha.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL OVER
    YOUR EXISTING SETUP!

 3. REVIEW THE WHATSNEW.TXT for this alpha.  The WHATSNEW is structured to show
    what has been added/fixed between alphas, and also provides documentation
    for new or changed features.

 4. Your BBS should be completely offline when you perform the upgrades.

 5. REMEMBER #1 TO BACKUP YOUR BBS DIRECTORY! :)

[ INDIVIDUAL ALPHA UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS - FOR 1.11 TO A39 SEE THE NEXT SECTION ]

 .--------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A44 to A45 |-------------------------
 `--------------------------------'

 - This is just mostly a bugfix release and only requires the binaries to be
   replaced with the new ones.  You must be running A44 already.

   You can do this by running:

      install replace c:\mystic
      ./install replace /mystic

   Where /mystic is your BBS root directory.  If you're using a Unix based
   system of course you will need to have access to replace the files.

 .--------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A43 to A44 |-------------------------
 `--------------------------------'

 - This is a big upgrade with lots of internal changes, so please it is very
   crucial that you make a backup before proceeding.

 - Extract Mystic archive to a folder.

 - Replace existing binaries with the new alpha binaries:

      mystic.exe
      mis.exe
      fidopoll.exe
      mutil.exe
      nodespy.exe
      qwkpoll.exe
      upgrade.exe
      mplc.exe
      mide.exe

    You can do this automatically by typing "install replace <mystic dir>"
    Example: install replace c:\mystic

    If you prefer to manually copy files, you can install Mystic to a temp
    directory and just copy the files installed in the new fresh installation
    over the old ones (this holds true for all steps here).

 - Type "install extract prompts.dat <mystic data dir>" or you can install A44
   to a temporarily directory and manually copy prompts.dat from the A44 data
   directory.  Example: install extract prompts.dat c:\mystic\data

 - If you use the default bulletin system (bulletin.mps) then you may want to
   replace it with an updated version that takes into consideration some of the
   theme inheritance features.  install extract bulletin.mps c:\mystic\scripts

 - Switch to root Mystic directory and run upgrade.exe

 - Recompile all MPL scripts (mplc -all in your root Mystic directory)

   Note: Because mide/mplc.exe are sometimes stored in multiple locations it
   may be that the A44 mide/mplc.exe files get overwritten during the upgrade
   process.  If that happens you can extract them by using the install utility:

     install extract mplc.exe c:\mystic
     install extract mide.exe c:\mystic

   The new recommended location for mplc is to keep it in the root Mystic
   directory moving forward.

 - Run upgrade.exe once to update your data files then you can
   delete it.

 - Add prompts #528-#537 to the prompt file for all themes you have
   on your BBS.  If you use the default prompts and have not customized,
   then you can simply replace default.txt in the DATA folder with that
   from the fresh installation.  These new prompts can be found below or
   in default.txt in the fresh installation.  See whatsnew for more
   information.

   you will need to modify "str7" to include the Draft option by adding a
   F at the end of the hotkey list and then adding "D-Save as Draft" into
   the list of options.  Use the default msg_editor.ini to guide you if
   you need help.

    you will need to be aware of that and possibly reconfigure your servers
    in the System Configuration and edit any auto-start scripts you may use
  - Recompile all MPL programs (run mplc -all in scripts directory)
  - Note that the phonebook in NodeSpy has changed slightly in A35, and in
    some cases you may need to edit out the "port" from the address field

   the msg_editor* files from the A23 TEXT directory over into your BBSes text
   directory for each theme you use.  That's it you're done.

   If you have a CUSTOM message editor template, then you will want to review
   the following options in the msg_editor.ini from A24 and add them into your
   template.  You can also remove the "[Options] suggestion" option as it is
   used.

      [Options] auto_suggest

   files for how to enable the spell checking on every platform supported by
   Mystic.  You may wish to take a look at this and enable the amazing spell
   checker that Mystic now provides, but this is completely optional of course

 - Go into QWK Networks and make sure they are set to Active if you use QWK
   networking.

 `--------------------------------'

 - Replace all binary executable files with the new A21

 .--------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A19 TO A20 |-------------------------
 `--------------------------------'

  - MAKE A BACKUP IN CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG!

  - Replace all binary executable files with the new A19:

      mystic.exe
      mis.exe
      fidopoll.exe
      mutil.exe
      mbbsutil.exe
      nodespy.exe
      qwkpoll.exe
      upgrade.exe
      mplc.exe (in scripts directory)
      mide.exe (in scripts directory)

  - If you use all of the default prompts that come with Mystic as opposed to
    customized prompts, then you can copy default.txt from the A20 data.

    If you have customized your theme you will need to "replace" 3 prompts in
    your default.txt (and any other themes you use) with these new prompts:

     ; TELNET/RLOGIN: Connecting prompt &1 = address &2 = port
     354 |CR|08> |07Escape sequence is |08|15CTRL+|15]|08.|CR|08> |07Connecting to |15|&1 |07port |15|&2|08.|CR

     355 |08> |07Connected.

     ; TELNET/RLOGIN: Unable to connect
     356 |08> |12Unable to connect: Press a key|PN

 .--------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A18 TO A19 |-------------------------
 `--------------------------------'

  - MAKE A BACKUP IN CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG!

  - Replace all binary executable files with the new A19:

      mystic.exe
      mis.exe
      fidopoll.exe
      mutil.exe
      mbbsutil.exe
      nodespy.exe
      qwkpoll.exe
      upgrade.exe
      mplc.exe (in scripts directory)
      mide.exe (in scripts directory)

  - Copy the new msg_editor* files from the A19 text directory into the text
    directory of each theme you have.

  - If you use #B or #I MCI codes anywhere in your BBS they need to be updated
    See WHATSNEW for more information.  If you use only the defaults then you
    can copy over the archive_view and ansimidx files which used the #I code:

  - Copy archive_view.ini into your text directory of each theme, or you can
    update str9 that uses the #I display code to use the new format of #I.  If
    you have a custom archive viewer look, its easier to just update the str9

  - Copy ansimidx.ini into your text directory of each theme, or you can
    update str8 that uses the #I display code to use the new format of #I.  Any
    options you've changed will obviously need to be reconfigured if you choose
    to copy over the default, so updating the str8 will be easiest if you have
    a customized version.

  - Run upgrade.exe to update your data files to the new A19 formats.

  - Delete update.exe and upgrade.exe in your root directory if its there after
    running the upgrade.

 .-----------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A6-A17 TO A18 |-------------------------
 `-----------------------------------'

  - Replace all binary executable files.  Don't forget MIDE and MPLC in the
    scripts directory!

  - Execute MPLC -ALL from scripts directory, which will recompile your MPL
    programs to be compatible with the new engine update.

  - Run MUTIL's file base packer to regenerate your file indexes.
    THIS MUST BE DONE IF UPGRADING FROM ANYTHING PRIOR TO A17 (A6-A16).

 .-----------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A5 TO 1.12 A6 |-------------------------
 `-----------------------------------'

  - Replace all binary executable files
  - Copy archive_view.ans and archive_view.ini to your TEXT directory of each
    theme you have.

 .-----------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A4 TO 1.12 A5 |-------------------------
 `-----------------------------------'

  - Replace all binary executable files
  - Delete CFGROOT.AN1 from your data directory
  - Copy CFGROOT1.ANS from the A5 data directory into your data directory

 .-----------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A3 TO 1.12 A4 |-------------------------
 `-----------------------------------'

  - Just replace the old A3 .EXE files with the A4 versions to upgrade.

    If you are upgrading from a version prior to A3 then you need to copy over
    the A4 binaries, add all new/changed prompts, copy the new A4 protocol.dat,
    recompile MPL files, and then run update.exe to upgrade data files to A3+

 .-----------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.12 A2 TO 1.12 A3 |-------------------------
 `-----------------------------------'

  - Make sure you do a FULL BACK UP your system because there are many data file
    changes in this version, and a large amount of rewrites to things behind the
    scenes.  Once you upgrade there is no going back unless you restore a
    backup.

  - Replace all old .EXE files with new ones from A3 (do not forget MPLC and MIDE
    in the scripts directory).

  - Update the following changed prompts into your data\default.txt file and any
    other prompt sets you're using:

      ; Press ENTER to start file transfer  &1=selected protocol
      ; First word is input chars, followed by display text
      065 SQ |CR|09Press |01[|15ENTER|01/|15S|01]|09tart or |01[|15ESCAPE|01/|15Q|01]|09uit your |15|&1 |09transfer: |XX

      ; Message from another node footer. First word contains input keys, followed by prompt
      145 RC |CR|09Node Message: |01[|10R|01]|09eply, |01[|10C|01]|09hat, or |01[|10ENTER|01/|10Continue|01]|09: |15

  - Copy update.exe into your root Mystic directory and run it one time.  This
    will perform various work on your data files for the new version.  You can
    delete update.exe now.

  - Recompile all MPL programs that you use (mplc -all in the scripts
    directory)

  - The protocol format has changed, and it is recommended you copy over the
    new protocol.dat from A3, especially if you do not use other external
    protocols.  Note that the file format has changed, so you must have
    already ran upgrade.exe before you can copy the A3 protocol.dat over.

  - If you use the a preset upload base in the File Base Settings make sure it
    is pointing to the correct file base, as the numbering is now done by the
    the unique base ID.

 .--------------------------------.
 | UPGRADING FROM 1.11 TO 1.12 A2 |----------------------------
 `--------------------------------'

  - Copy over new binaries (do not forget mide and mplc in scripts!)

  - Recompile all MPL programs (mplc -all in scripts) (not sure if needed)

  - Replace UNUSED prompt #315 in your default.txt (and any other themes)
    with this one:

	; Ask for character translation (DOS CP437 or UTF8)
	; &1 = Detected terminal type (or Unknown)
	315 |CR|14[|150|14] MS-DOS CP437|CR[|151|14] UTF-8|CR|CRSelect Terminal Codepage [|15Enter = CP437|14]: |XX

  - The default protocol.dat has been updated to include the new internal Xmodem,
    Ymodem, Zmodem so if you want to use them you can copy the protocol.dat from
    the A1 installation over your old one.

  - There are some minor additions to MUTIL.INI please see the whatsnew.txt
    and/or look at the new MUTIL.INI for more information.

 - Perform the following final steps:

     - You must run MUTIL's file base packer in order to regenerate index
       files for your file areas.'

     - If you use QWK networking, go into your QWK networks in the
       configuration and set them to "Active" as they can now be toggled off
       or on.

     - If you've configured a preset upload base in the File Base settings make
       sure it matches the correct ID in the file base editor for the base you
       want uploads to be placed.

     - Similar to the above, if you use the MX menu command to post text files,
       make sure the ID matches the ID in the message base editor for the base
       you want to post to.
