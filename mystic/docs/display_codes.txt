 A.1  USING Mystic DISPLAY CODES
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mystic Display Codes are found throughout the BBS in various prompts
    and display files.  The purpose of these codes is to replace the code
    with a corresponding value for that code.  For example, if you wanted
    to display the user's name, there is a code which when parsed in a
    prompt or file would be replaced with the current logged in user name.

    The format for all codes consists of a starting pipe character (|)
    followed by two characters which are used to represent what data
    Mystic will replace the code with.  These codes are CASE SENSITIVE
    although currently only uppercased letters are being used.

    An example of an MCI code and how it would be processed by Mystic
    would be:

       Welcome the BBS, |UH.

    In the above example, |UH is the MCI code for the user's handle.  If
    the current user online had a account handle of "Joe User", then the
    result of the above example after being processed by Mystic would
    be:

       Welcome to the BBS, Joe User.

    Certain display codes require additional data to be provided after
    the code.  These types of codes are used to do many different things
    from text formatting, to changing input fields, to saving/restoring
    the remote user's screen, all the way through to popping up windows
    and performaning various other BBS functions.

    Once again it is important to note that all display codes are CASE
    SENSITIVE!

    The following sections will cover all types of MCI codes used by
    Mystic BBS.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A.3  COLOR CHANGING CODES (PIPE COLOR CODES)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The typical pipe format of <pipe>## where ## is one of the following:

   00 : Sets the current foreground to Black
   01 : Sets the current foreground to Dark Blue
   02 : Sets the current foreground to Dark Green
   03 : Sets the current foreground to Dark Cyan
   04 : Sets the current foreground to Dark Red
   05 : Sets the current foreground to Dark Magenta
   06 : Sets the current foreground to Brown
   07 : Sets the current foreground to Grey
   08 : Sets the current foreground to Dark Grey
   09 : Sets the current foreground to Light Blue
   10 : Sets the current foreground to Light Green
   11 : Sets the current foreground to Light Cyan
   12 : Sets the current foreground to Light Red
   13 : Sets the current foreground to Light Magenta
   14 : Sets the current foreground to Yellow
   15 : Sets the current foreground to White

   16 : Sets the current background to Black
   17 : Sets the current background to Blue
   18 : Sets the current background to Green
   19 : Sets the current background to Cyan
   20 : Sets the current background to Red
   21 : Sets the current background to Magenta
   22 : Sets the current background to Brown
   23 : Sets the current background to Grey

   Depending on the terminal the 24-31 codes can have different results.  Some
   terminals will use iCE colors which are the non-blinking brighter
   backgrounds.  Others may use blinking text instead.

   TERMINALS THAT USE BRIGHT BACKGROUNDS (ICE COLORS):

   24 : Sets the current background to Dark Grey
   25 : Sets the current background to Light Blue
   26 : Sets the current background to Light Green
   27 : Sets the current background to Light Cyan
   28 : Sets the current background to Light Red
   29 : Sets the current background to Light Magenta
   30 : Sets the current background to light Yellow
   31 : Sets the current background to light White

   TERMINALS THAT USE BLINKING:

   24 : Sets the current background to black with blinking foreground
   25 : Sets the current background to blue with blinking foreground
   26 : Sets the current background to green with blinking foreground
   27 : Sets the current background to cyan with blinking foreground
   28 : Sets the current background to red with blinking foreground
   29 : Sets the current background to magenta with blinking foreground
   30 : Sets the current background to brown with blinking foreground
   31 : Sets the current background to grey with blinking foreground

   T1 : Sets current color to theme's color #1
   T2 : Sets current color to theme's color #2
   T3 : Sets current color to theme's color #3
   T4 : Sets current color to theme's color #4
   T5 : Sets current color to theme's color #5
   T6 : Sets current color to theme's color #6
   T7 : Sets current color to theme's color #7
   T8 : Sets current color to theme's color #8
   T9 : Sets current color to theme's color #9
   T0 : Sets current color to theme's color #0


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A.4  Text Formatting Codes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Text formatting codes are most often used within the prompts file to
   create aligned lists of data, for things such as the user list or 
   who's online, etc.  These codes, like many other display codes, set up
   the circumstances in which the display code after it are displayed

   Note: ## should be replaced by the number noted in the description, and
   must always be two characters.

   $C##  - Centers the value of the next display code with a width of ##
   $D##C - Duplicates character C ## times
   $L##  - Left pad the next display code with spaces to ## characters
   $R##  - Right pad the next display code with spaces to ## characters
   $X##C - Duplicate character C until column ##

   $c##C - Centers the value of the next display with a width of ## using
           character C
   $l##C - Left pad the next display code with character <C> to ## characters
   $r##C - Right pad the next display code with character <C> to ## chars

   Examples (pay attention to the quotes):

      |UN translates to........: "User Name"

      |$R30|UN translates to...: "User Name                     "
      |$C30|UN translates to...: "          User Name           "
      |$L30|UN translates to...: "                     User Name"

      |$D30- translates to.....: "------------------------------"
      |$X30- translates to.....: "------------------------------"

      |UN|$X30. translates to..: "User Name....................."

      |$c30.|UN translates to...: ".........User Name..........."
      |$r30.|UN translates to..: "User Name....................."
      |$l30.|UN translates to..: ".....................User Name"

   The difference between $D and $X is that D duplicates a set number of
   characters, while $X duplicates that character until a certain column
   is reached.  If you use $X30- on column 10, it will create 20 characters
   so it is dependant on the current location of the cursor.
   
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A.5  Screen/Cursor Related Codes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Note: ## should be replaced by the number noted in the description, and
   must always be two characters.  For example, to move to column 1 on the
   current line you would send |[X01

   [A## - Move the cursor up ## lines
   [B## - Move the cursor down ## lines
   [C## - Move the cursor forward (to the right) ## columns
   [D## - Move the cursor backwards (to the left) ## columns
   [K   - Clear from the current cursor position to the end of the line
   [L   - Move cursor and erase data backwards from current column to column ##
   [X## - Move cursor to X coordinate ##
   [Y## - Move cursor to Y coordinate ##
   BS   - Sends 1 destructive backspace sequence (ASCII 8-32-8)
   CL   - Clears the screen (ANSI 1,1 locate and [2J or ASCII 12)
   CR   - Send a carrage return and line feed (move to next line)
   RA   - Restore the saved text attribute color
   RS   - Restore the saved user's terminal screen
   SA   - Save the current text attribute color
   SS   - Save the entire user's terminal screen

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A.6  Input Field Manipulation Codes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Input field codes effect the next input field of its type, and are
   generally used in prompt strings that are send prior to asking the user
   for input.

   -N   - Forces the next Yes/No prompt to default to a No answer
   -Y   - Forces the next Yes/No prompt to default to a Yes answer
   IF   - Turns off the input field background color for the next input
          prompt.
   IN## - Sets the scrolling input field size for the next input prompt to
          ## characters.  If the maximum size of the input field is larger
          than this, Mystic will scroll the text inside so that it can
          accept more characters without taking up more than ## on screen.
   IS## - Limits the actual maximum number of characters allow for an
          input prompt to ## characters.


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A.7  Text Box Notification Codes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Text Box codes are used to pop up a quick notification box, using the
  configured box type of the current theme for visuals.

  In addition to just displaying a box, Mystic is able to use its remote
  screen imaging to save the space behind the box and restore it once the
  box is closed, depending on the type of code used.  This prevents any
  corruption of the users screen regardless of what they are doing when
  they receive the notification.

  User and BBS data MCI codes, along with pipe color codes can be used
  within these boxes.

     #B<header>#<notification>#

       The #B code opens a notification box with a <header> and <notification>
       string, following by an "OK" prompt for the user to press a key.  After
       the user pressed a key, Mystic will automatically restore the user's
       original screen content that was overwritten by the box.

       Example:

         |#BThis is a header#This is a test notification box!#


     #I<header>#<notification>#

       This box is similar to the #B notification, except that it does not
       restore the user's screen content after displaying, and it does not
       wait for the user to press a key.  One use for this might be during
       a new message scan "Scanning" prompt, for example. 

         |#BNew Message Scan#Scanning: |&1...#


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A.8  Miscellaneous Unsorted Codes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   AO   - Used in display files to disable aborting of the display file
   BE   - Sends a ^G character to the terminal (beep code on some terms)
   DE   - Delay for half a second
   PA   - Send the pause prompt and wait for a key to be pressed
   PB   - Purge the current input buffer
   PI   - Display a pipe symbol (|)
   PN   - Wait for a key to be pressed without prompting
   PO   - Used in display files to disable pausing for that display file
   QO   - Replaced with a randomly generated Quote of the Day
   RP## - Sets the internal screen pause line counter to ##
   XX   - Returns no value

   DF<file>| - Send display file <file> Example: |DFmyansi|

   DI## - Sets the baud rate of the current display file, using the
          following scale:
  
            00 -    = No baud emulation
            01 - 09 = 300 baud
            10 - 19 = 1200 baud
            20 - 29 = 2400 baud
            30 - 39 = 4800 baud
            40 - 49 = 9600 baud
            50 - 59 = 19200 baud
            60 - 69 = 28800 baud
            70 - 79 = 38460 baud
            80 - 89 = 57600 baud
            90 - 99 = 115200 baud

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A.9  Prompt Info Codes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Prompt Info codes are used within the prompts found in a theme's prompt
   file.  The value of each prompt is dynamic, and changes depending on
   each specific prompt.

   The prompt editor and the prompt file itself will have comments which
   show what each Prompt Info code's value means for that prompt.  For an
   example, lets look at prompt #334:

     334 Jump to which message? (1-|&2):
 
   In this prompt, &1 is replaced by the current message number, and &2
   is replaced by the total number of messages in the base.  These values
   are noted in the comments for that particular prompt in both the editor
   and the prompt file.

   Prompt Info codes currently range from &0-&9, and from &A-&E

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A.10  Screen Info Codes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Note: These codes are slowly being depreciated because they're annoying
   to use.  The newer templates will have screen coordinates defined within
   a .INI-like text file.
